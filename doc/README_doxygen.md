\section intro_sec Introduction

This is the developer documentation for Qyra, a cutting-edge cryptographic library designed to offer post-quantum
security through a hash algorithm resistant to quantum attacks. Qyra leverages Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and
Kyber to provide enhanced protection in a decentralized environment, ensuring secure data processing and cryptographic
operations without reliance on central authorities.

The software is a community-driven open source project, released under the MIT license.

See https://github.com/marcofortina/qyra for further information about the project.
